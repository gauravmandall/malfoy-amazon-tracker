## 1. Architecture and Design Choices

### 1.1 Overall Application Architecture

The Next.js E-commerce Price Tracker is built using a modern, component-based architecture following the principles of the Next.js App Router. The application is structured to optimize for both performance and developer experience, with a clear separation of concerns between UI components, data fetching, and business logic.

    E --> H["Web Scraping Logic"]
    E --> I["Rate Limiting"]
    E --> J["Caching"]
    H --> K["External E-commerce Sites"]
```

### 1.2 Component Structure

The application follows a hierarchical component structure:

- **Page Components**: Top-level components that represent entire pages (`page.tsx` files)
- **Layout Components**: Components that define the layout structure (header, footer)
- **Feature Components**: Specialized components for specific features (price tracker form, product card)
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements from shadcn/ui (buttons, cards, inputs)

This structure promotes reusability and maintainability by encapsulating related functionality and UI elements.

### 1.3 Data Fetching Strategies

The application employs a hybrid approach to data fetching:

- **Server-Side API Routes**: Used for web scraping operations to fetch product data from e-commerce sites. This approach keeps sensitive operations and logic on the server.
- **Client-Side Fetching**: Used for communicating with the application's own API routes from the browser.

This hybrid approach provides several benefits:
- Protects scraping logic from being exposed to the client
- Enables server-side rate limiting and caching
- Allows for a responsive UI during data fetching operations

### 1.4 Routing Mechanisms

The application uses Next.js App Router for routing:

- **Static Routes**: Home page (`/`)
- **Dynamic Routes**: Product pages (`/[...productPath]`)
- **API Routes**: Backend functionality (`/api/track-price`)

The dynamic route pattern `[...productPath]` is particularly useful as it allows the application to handle various product URL formats from e-commerce sites.

### 1.5 State Management

The application uses React's built-in state management solutions:

- **Local Component State**: Managed with `useState` hooks for component-specific state
- **Form State**: Managed within form components with controlled inputs
- **Loading States**: Dedicated states to track loading, success, and error conditions

This approach was chosen for its simplicity and sufficiency for the current application scope. As the application grows, more sophisticated state management solutions could be considered.

### 1.6 Design Patterns

Several design patterns are employed throughout the application:

- **Component Composition**: UI is composed of smaller, reusable components
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separation between data-fetching logic and UI rendering
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulation of reusable logic (e.g., form validation)
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of runtime errors

### 1.7 Rationale for Architectural Choices

- **Next.js App Router**: Chosen for its file-based routing, built-in API routes, and optimized rendering strategies
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Promotes reusability, testability, and maintainability
- **Server-Side Scraping**: Protects scraping logic, enables rate limiting, and avoids CORS issues
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui**: Offers a consistent design system with minimal CSS overhead

## 3. Tradeoffs and Assumptions

### 3.1 Technology Selection Tradeoffs

#### Next.js vs. Other Frameworks
- **Tradeoff**: Chose Next.js over alternatives like Remix or SvelteKit
- **Rationale**: Next.js offers a mature ecosystem, excellent documentation, and strong TypeScript support
- **Impact**: Positive impact on developer productivity, but potentially higher initial bundle size

#### Direct Web Scraping vs. Third-Party APIs
- **Tradeoff**: Implemented direct web scraping instead of using e-commerce APIs
- **Rationale**: Most e-commerce platforms don't offer public APIs for price data
- **Impact**: More control over data extraction, but increased maintenance burden and potential for breakage when site structures change

#### Server-Side Rendering vs. Static Generation
- **Tradeoff**: Used client-side rendering with server-side API routes instead of full SSR
- **Rationale**: Price data needs to be fresh, and user inputs determine what data to fetch
- **Impact**: More responsive UI for user interactions, but potentially slower initial data display

### 3.2 Feature Prioritization

#### Price Tracking vs. Price History
- **Tradeoff**: Focused on current price checking rather than historical price tracking
- **Rationale**: Current price checking provides immediate value with simpler implementation
- **Impact**: Quicker time-to-market, but less comprehensive price analysis

#### Limited Marketplace Support
- **Tradeoff**: Initially supporting only Amazon.com and Amazon.in
- **Rationale**: Amazon has the largest product catalog and consistent URL structure
- **Impact**: Covers a large portion of use cases, but limits utility for users shopping on other platforms

#### Simple Authentication vs. User Accounts
- **Tradeoff**: No user authentication in the initial version
- **Rationale**: Simplifies initial development and allows focus on core functionality
- **Impact**: Faster development, but lacks personalization and saved product tracking

### 3.3 Performance Optimization Decisions

#### In-Memory Caching vs. Database Storage
- **Tradeoff**: Used in-memory caching for product data
- **Rationale**: Simpler implementation with good performance for moderate traffic
- **Impact**: Faster development and good performance for small to medium scale, but limited persistence and scalability

#### Rate Limiting Implementation
- **Tradeoff**: Implemented simple in-memory rate limiting
- **Rationale**: Provides basic protection against abuse without external dependencies
- **Impact**: Adequate for moderate traffic, but may not scale well for high-traffic scenarios

#### Client-Side Form Validation
- **Tradeoff**: Implemented form validation on both client and server
- **Rationale**: Provides immediate feedback to users while ensuring data integrity
- **Impact**: Better user experience, with minimal performance impact

### 3.4 Assumptions

#### User Behavior Assumptions
- **Assumption**: Users primarily want to check current prices rather than historical trends
- **Impact**: Simplified initial feature set, but may miss opportunities for deeper price analysis

#### E-commerce Site Structure Assumptions
- **Assumption**: Amazon's product page structure remains relatively stable
- **Impact**: Scraping logic may break if Amazon significantly changes their HTML structure

#### Traffic and Usage Assumptions
- **Assumption**: Moderate traffic levels with occasional spikes
- **Impact**: In-memory caching and rate limiting may be insufficient for high traffic

#### Device and Browser Assumptions
- **Assumption**: Users primarily access the application on modern browsers and devices
- **Impact**: May not provide optimal experience on older browsers or low-end devices
